I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)", "overall": 5.0, "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "category": "Electronics > Computers & Accessories > Tablet Accessories > Chargers & Adapters", "price": "$18.95"}

The installation instructions were Moderately clear.  No issues following them, they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing on.My shipment had a mis-cut piece, and was missing 4 screws.  I contacted the Manufacturer, and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day (Shipped out of Texas, so normal mailing times applied)I like how the Mount fits together, and I easily mounted my 60lbs TV by myself.  The part that attaches to the TV has a hook that will hold the TV on the Arm till you bolt it on.It's very adjustable, and pushes almost flush with the wall.I'm very happy, but took one star for the miscut piece.", "overall": 4.0, "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "category": "Electronics > Accessories & Supplies > Audio & Video Accessories > TV Accessories & Parts > TV Ceiling & Wall Mounts", "price": "$34.99"}
